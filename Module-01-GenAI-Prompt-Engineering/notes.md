# 1. Generative AI Models

## What are Foundation Models?

Foundation models are large-scale AI models trained on massive amounts of unstructured data using self-supervised learning.

They learn general patterns (for example, predicting the next word in a sentence) and can later be adapted or tuned for many different downstream tasks such as classification, sentiment analysis, or named entity recognition.

Their key strength is **transferability** — the same model can perform multiple tasks.

## What are Generative AI Models?

Generative AI models are foundation models that generate new content by predicting the next most probable token (word, image element, or code token) based on context.

For example:

> “No use crying over spilled ___”

The model predicts:

> “milk”

This next-token prediction ability is what makes them generative.

## Where are they used?

- **Large Language Models** like ChatGPT for text generation  
- **Code generation tools** like GitHub Copilot  
- **Image generation models** like DALL·E  
- **Scientific models** such as molecule discovery systems  
- **Climate and geospatial prediction systems**

---

## Advantages

- Strong performance due to large-scale pretraining  
- Requires less labeled data for downstream tasks  
- Can be adapted using prompting or fine-tuning  

---

## Disadvantages

- High training and inference cost (compute intensive)  
- Trust and bias concerns due to internet-scale training data  
- Difficult to fully verify training datasets  

---

## Conclusion

Foundation models are powerful because they are trained on massive datasets to learn general patterns rather than task-specific rules. Their core capability is next-token prediction, which enables content generation. By using prompting or small amounts of labeled data, they can be adapted to many tasks without training from scratch. However, they come with high computational cost and potential bias risks.
